Description: This package performs differential rhythmicity testing of gene sets 
    from RNA-seq datasets using gene scores. User-defined gene sets can be 
    enriched for highly rhythmic and phase coherent gene sets in one group or highly 
    differentially rhythmic and phase coherent gene sets between two groups.
